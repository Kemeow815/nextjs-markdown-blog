## 🔧 Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

- **Node.js** (Version 14 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **yarn**

## 📝 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

\```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nextjs-blog-tutorial.git
\```

### 2. Install dependencies

Navigate into the project directory and install the required dependencies:

\```bash
cd nextjs-blog-tutorial
npm install
# OR
yarn install
\```

### 3. Create your blog posts

To add blog posts, navigate to the `posts/` directory and create Markdown files (e.g., `sample-article.md`). Each file should contain your article's front matter and content in Markdown format.

Here’s a simple example of a Markdown file:

\```markdown
---
title: "My First Blog Post"
date: "2024-11-01"
---

This is my first blog post using **Markdown** and **Next.js**. It’s really easy to create content!
\```

### 4. Run the development server

Once the dependencies are installed, start the Next.js development server:

\```bash
npm run dev
# OR
yarn dev
\```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view your blog. The posts will automatically be pulled from the `posts/` directory and rendered dynamically.

## 📜 Project Structure

Here’s a breakdown of the main files and directories:

- **pages/**: Contains all of your application’s pages. The `index.tsx` file renders the homepage and `posts/[slug].tsx` handles individual blog post pages.
- **lib/posts.ts**: A utility file to read the Markdown files and parse them into content.
- **posts/**: Directory where your blog posts in Markdown format reside.
- **public/**: Contains static assets like images, CSS, and fonts.

## 🖋️ Customization

- **Styling**: Feel free to customize the design by modifying `styles/globals.css` or adding your own CSS.
- **SEO**: You can improve SEO by adding a `<Head>` tag inside the `pages/_document.tsx` to include metadata for better search engine indexing.
